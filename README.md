# Eco-Learn Project

The Eco-Learn project is divided into three main parts:
1. **eco-learn-app**
2. **eco-learn-backend**
3. **eco-learn-web3**

The entire MVP has been deployed on Vercel and can be accessed [here](https://eco-learn-app.vercel.app/).

Each part of the project has its own `README.md` file with instructions on how to run that part.
